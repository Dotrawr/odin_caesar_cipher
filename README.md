## Caesar Cipher

This repo contains my implementation of the Caesar Cipher as described in The Odin Project.

The documentation says to: 

  ```Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string```
  
and gives this example:
```ruby
  > caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
  => "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
```

So it seems I need to take a string and shift each character over by the shift factor.
